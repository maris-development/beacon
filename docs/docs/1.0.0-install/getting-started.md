# Getting Started with the Beacon Data Lake

To quickly get started with the Beacon Data Lake, we have created a example repository that contains a complete setup of the Beacon Data Lake using Docker Compose. This example repository is available at [beacon-example](https://github.com/maris-development/beacon-example).

It contains a complete setup of the Beacon Data Lake using Docker Compose, including the following features:

- Docker Compose setup for the Beacon Data Lake
- Example datasets in various formats (netcdf, parquet)
