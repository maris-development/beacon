# How To Use

Beacon Binary Format is a file format that can be directly queried by Beacon. Once it's stored inside the `/data/dataset` folder of the Beacon instance, it can be queried by the Beacon API.

It can also be registered as a table in the Beacon instance in the exact same way as a CSV or Parquet file.
