# Querying

In this section, we will explore how you can query data from Beacon. Beacon provides a flexible and powerful query interface that allows you to retrieve specific data based on your requirements. By constructing a JSON query object and sending a POST request to the query endpoint (e.g. `https://beacon-{collection-name}.maris.nl/api/query`), you can retrieve data that matches your specified column_names, filters, and other criteria.
