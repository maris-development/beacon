# Admin Panel

The admin panel is a powerful tool that allows you to manage your Beacon server. It is accessible by navigating to the `/admin/swagger` route of your server. You will be prompted to log in with your admin credentials. These admin credentials are set during the initial setup of your Beacon server.

Using the admin panel, you can manage your Beacon Server itself, the datasets imported or you want to import, tracking directories and other administrative features.

It is available at the `/admin/swagger` route of your server.

## Interface

The interface is a simple swagger interface that allows you to interact with your server. You can view and test your endpoints. You can also view the documentation for the endpoints.
